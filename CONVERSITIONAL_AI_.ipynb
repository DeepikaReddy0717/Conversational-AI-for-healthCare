At that time, it looked fine and till now, she had no pain or any sensitivity issues in eating. But off late, the color of the chipped tooth has turned green. We consulted two dentists, first one was a specialist in child dentistry and recommended an RCT treatment wherein a chemical will be placed to cure the infection. He said that the discoloration will increase with time and this baby tooth might fall off much earlier (in 4 to 5 years) than the expected time (6 to 8 years). The other dentist recommended to observe for six months and see if any rash or boil is developed above the gums and any kind of pain is experienced. He also said that such a tooth might fall off before time. We are confused as to what we should do? If RCT is the way out then we would prefer to get it done before she starts with her formal schooling at 3. But we are mainly concerned if she could endure such a treatment as she is very small. Please provide suggestion.

Yes, daytime sleepiness occurs due to sleep apnea. If it is present in its severe obstructive form, it can cause a host of cardiac diseases like atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The exercise intolerance initially develops the consequence of early heart failure. Also at your age, you may be suffering from chronotropic incompetence, that is, the inability to increase heart rate with exercise, and regular graded exercise will help you. Stay off from alcohol and cannabis.\",\n          \"Hello. What you have told is correct. To prevent relapse of acne one needs to complete a total dose of 120 mg/kg of Isotretinoin. As your weight is 55 kg you should be taking a total of 6600 mg of Isotretinoin to prevent relapse. That comes out to be 330 days of 20 mg per day of Isotretinoin. That is almost 11 months of 20 mg Isotretinoin. This dose is recommended to prevent relapse of acne.\",\n          \"Hi.  Nucynta is an opioid analgesic, that has high first-pass metabolism when administered orally. It means only 32 % of orally administered dose reaches blood. After it produces its effect, 97 % gets metabolized in gastrointestine and liver and gets excreted out from body through urine.   In your case, you have delayed (slow) intestinal movements, hence the drug may get faster metabolism and faster excretion than a normal individual. Hence, I think it is not detectable in blood or urine.   Another possibility is very less amount of drug reaches your blood (less than 32 %) due to intestinal absorption issues. The half-life of this drug is four hours in healthy individual. It means, after oral administration, 32 % drug reaches the blood within 3 to 4 hours. If I draw the blood after four hours of oral administration, the amount showing in blood is expected to be 16 % (50 % of drug gets excreted by four hours). It is in a normal person. In your case, when to draw blood is the question. So, individualistic reasearch could be done for you with special care.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "AI: Hi. Headache has numerous causes. And according to your presentation, I am going to list some of the causes that could be the reason for what you experience. Please, reflect them to your case. 1. Beginning of acute upper respiratory tract infection, in case you show other signs including runny nose, cough, sore throat or others of cold and flu symptoms. 2. Frontal headache can be due to paranasal sinus inflammation which is part of cold and flu symptoms or part of long-term inflammation. 3. Stress, lack of sleep, anxiety or bad mood. 4. Bad sleeping position (for the neck) or uncomfortable pillow (usually comes in the morning and back of neck and head but can be in the front as well). 5. Anemia (commonly iron deficiency anemia, specially if you are having the monthly period these days). 6. PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) few days before monthly period. 7. Frontal headache can come with disturbed visual acuity (you might need to visit ophthalmologist for eye test) especially if have concomitant blurring of vision. 8. Head trauma, in case you experienced that before the beginning of that headache. 9. Diabetes mellitus type 2. 10. Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) in case you are not following appropriate diet or not eating well. 11. Vitamin D deficiency (but usually for long term headache with other symptoms). I will list some of the investigations to do and medicines to take (for a few days). FBS (requires fasting 8 to 10 hours), HbA1c, complete blood count, Fe studies. Naproxen 500 mg tablets one tablet per 12 hours after meals for 3 to 5 days, as needed.\n",

The bumps you are referring to are small tonsillar cysts which do not carry any significance. They are benign and are not a cause to worry. The tonsils are only slightly enlarged and hence do not need any removal.\n",
